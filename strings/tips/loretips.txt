The world is dead. The Rot consumes all.
Despair is perspective.
Beyond the city lies nothing material, nothing worth dying for.
Some have attempted to sail the waters to the beyond. None have returned.
There are those amoungst the populace who dare to destroy the city from within its stewardship.
Agents of Cruelty appear to eradicate the hope of those who threaten the cycle.
Let failure not sway your conviction, nor fear.
In a world of rotten bodies, the power of spirit still holds.
Is there anything above, for some much below?
Begging, screaming, sobbing, they huddled in their homes. The sky was red, just as it always was.
Like a leech on the mind, the creation seeks from the master.
