Chattlestock, stick your nasal voids elsewhere.
Don't you have a sewer to be licking up, corpse?
I do no dealings with victims. Go away.
Stop snooping, poxbrain.
Your blood will be mine soon, decayvessel.
This is your mind speaking: Go eat steel nails and glup dung.
What an innocent face. I want to cut it!
Piss off, rothead.
By the corpulent one, you are ugly. Go away.
