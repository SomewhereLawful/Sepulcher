H... Hello... Forgive me... I was bled recently.
Your veins, blue and red. Makes me thirsty.
Hail, yet-bleeder. I desire vials, I care not from whom.
The corpulent one dehydrates. Help sate his thirst, yet-bleeder.
Your neck is well shaped, smooth. My jagged teeth wish to be there.
Let us keep this simple. I need blood. You and yours have plenty.
We thirst for the red metal taste. Fill our throats.
The chattlestock have been dried. Fill our blood stores.
He he he.... HA HA HA!! Oh... Sorry, I am livid.
